=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl Module allows you to define file-based dependencies similar to how
make works.Rather than placing the build rules in a separate Makefile or 
build.xml, the build rules are declared using standard Perl syntax. 
TinyMake is effectively an inline domain-specific language.
Using make you might write a makefile that looks like this...

 test: compile dataLoad
   # test
   touch test

 codeGen: database.spec
   # generate code
   touch codeGen

 compile: codeGen
   # compile code 
   touch compile

 dataLoad: codeGen
   # load data
   touch dataLoad

 database.spec: # source file

The equivalent perl code using TinyMake would look like this...

 use Sxoop::TinyMake ':all';

 file test => ["compile","dataLoad"], sub { # test
   `touch test`;
 } ;

 file codeGen => ["database.spec"], sub {  # generate code
   `touch codeGen`;
 } ;
  
 file compile => ["codeGen"], sub { # compile code
   `touch compile`;
 } ;

 file dataload => ["codeGen"], sub { # load data
   `touch dataLoad`;
 } ;

 make @ARGV;

Using TinyMake you declare a file dependency using the C<file>  subroutine.
This subroutine accepts a target filename as its first parameter,
and an arrayref of prerequisites and a rule coderef as its 2nd and 3rd 
parameters. The coderef passed in as the 3rd parameter will only be executed 
if the target file is out of date. 
A target file is considered to be out of date if ...

=over 4

=item 1.

the target file doesn't exist or...

=item 2.

any of the prerequisite files have been modified more recently than the target.

=back

TinyMake (as its name implies) is lacking in features, there are no implicit 
rules.
TinyMake doesn't know about C or any other programming language. All rules must be 
declared explicitly.
TinyMake provides the following subroutines...

=over 4

=item B<file>

   file $target => \@prerequisites, $code_reference;

The C<file> subroutine is used to declare a target, its prerequisites and a 
rule to invoke if the
target file is out of date. The supplied coderef does not get executed 
immediately. It will only be executed if the target is out of date. Typical 
usage would be...

 file "index.html" => ["bookmarks.txt", "site.xml"], sub {
   `xslfm -xsl index.xsl -files bookmarks.txt site.xml > index.html`;
 } ;

In the above example, C<index.html> is the target and both C<bookmarks.txt> 
and C<site.xml> are prerequisites. If any of these two files change then 
C<index.html> should be rebuilt. The rule to rebuild C<index.html> is the 
anonymous subroutine supplied as the 3rd parameter.

Just like Perl's native C<sort> subroutine, TinyMake exports some global 
variables which have special meaning within the scope of the supplied rule 
subroutine. These special variables are...

=over

=item B<$target> 

This is the target filename. This is equivalent to make's automatic variable C<$@>.

=item B<@changed> 

This is the list of prerequisite files which are newer than the target. This 
may not necessarily be all of the prerequisites supplied - only those which 
have changed since the target file was last modified. This is equivalent to 
make's automatic variable C<$?>.


=item B<@sources> 

This is the list of all prerequisite files which are dependents of the 
current target. This is equivalent to make's automatic variable C<$^>.

=back

Prerequisites must be enclosed in C<[ ... ]> square brackets. 

   file "../classes/Sample.class" => ["Sample.java"], sub {
     sh "javac @changed"
   };

To create Ant-style tasks, simply don't bother updating or touching the 
target file. 
No file modification dates are checked so the task will be executed if it is 
in the dependency tree for the active target.
The C<@changed> variable will contain all of the task's prerequisites, not 
just those that are newer than the target. 

=item B<make>
  
  make @targets

The C<make> subroutine kicks off the build process. make takes 1 or more 
filenames/targets as its parameters
and determines ...

=over

=item 1. 

The order in which the target and its prerequisites should be built.

=item 2.

Which (if any) prerequisites are out of date and must be built.

=back 

If no arguments are supplied to C<make> then (like make and Ant) it assumes 
the first target that was defined using C<file> is the target to check. For 
this reason you should create an "all" file/synonym at the start of your perl
script. make returns a list of changed targets.

=item B<filetree>

  filetree @dirs

This is a helper function which returns a list of all of the files in the 
specified directory and subdirectories.


=item B<sh>

  sh $command

This is a helper function which executes the supplied string using qx() after
 printing the string to STDOUT. sh returns the value returned from qx()

=item B<group>

 group  $symbolicTarget => \%target_source_map, sub { rule code }

Imagine a scenario in which you have a directory with a number of B<.txt> 
files in it. Each of the B<.txt> files must be converted to corresponding 
B<.html> files. Using standard makefile syntax you would do something like 
this...

   .SUFFIXES: .txt .html
  
   .txt.html:
       ${HTML_COMPILER} $< > $@

Using TinyMake there are 2 ways to do this. The first is to create a hash of 
html-to-txt files. This could be done as follows...

   my %html2txt = map {/(.*)txt$/; "$1html" => $_ } glob "*.txt";

The next step would be to call C<file> for each key/value combination as follows...

   foreach (keys %html2txt){
     file $_ => $txt2html{$_}, sub {
       # convert all .txt files to .html files
       `cp $changed[0] $target`;
     } ;
   } 

Once you've created a file target for each html file with a corresponding .txt 
file as the prerequisite, you would probably want to create a catchall target 
under which to group all of the html files...
 
 file html => [keys %html2txt];

You can now build all of the html files by calling C<make 'html';>. 
Since this kind of construct is pretty common there is a shorthand way to do this...

   group html => {map {/(.*)txt$/; "$1html" => $_} glob "*.txt"}, sub {
     # convert .txt file to .html
     `cp $changed[0] $target`;
   } ;

What this effectively does is create multiple file targets for each .html 
file and create a synonym called "html". Remember - the rule block for a 
group applies to each key/value pair in the supplied hash reference, not the 
group name which is really just a synonym. The rule block above will never be
 called with "html" as the target. Instead it will be called for each 
key/value combination where key is the target and value is the the 
prerequisite/s. 

=head1 SAMPLE CODE

The following code is a sample perl script that uses TinyMake to compile a 
tree of java source code and construct a C<.JAR> archive file from the 
built tree.

   use strict;
   use Sxoop::TinyMake ':all';
   
   my $sourcepath  = "./java";
   my $classpath   = "../lib/classes";
   my $outputpath  = "../bin";
   my $project_jar = "$outputpath/project.jar";
   #
   # build full jar by default
   #
   file default => $project_jar;
   #
   # create a map of .class to .java files
   #
   my %CLASS_JAVA =  map {
     /$sourcepath(.*)java$/; 
     "$outputpath$1class" => $_ 
   } grep /\.java$/, filetree $sourcepath;
   #
   # group the class-to-java map under the
   # 'compile' synonym
   #
   group compile => \%CLASS_JAVA, sub { 
     sh "javac -d $outputpath -classpath $classpath @changed" 
   } ;
   
   #
   # rebuild the jar if any of the .class files change
   #
   file $project_jar => [keys %CLASS_JAVA], sub {
     sh "jar -cvf $target -C $outputpath com";
   } ;

   #
   # clean build
   #
   file clean => sub { 
     sh "rm -R $outputpath/com";
     sh "rm $project_jar"; 
   };
     
   make @ARGV;

=head1 BUGS

'file' prerequisites must be filenames, you should not use a synonym as a 
prerequisite to a 'file'.
e.g. 

   # WRONG !!!
   file compile => ["project.html", "project.exe"];
   file "project.tgz" => "compile", sub { ... } ;

This is incorrect because TinyMake assumes that all prerequisites are files.
The correct way to do it is like this...

   # CORRECT 
   my $compile = ["project.html", "project.exe"];
   file compile => $compile;
   file "project.tgz" => $compile, sub { ... };

Please also refer to the java compilation example above.
